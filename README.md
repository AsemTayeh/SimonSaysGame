## Simon Says Game

### Overview

The Simon Says game is a simple memory-based game where the player must follow an increasing sequence of colors. The game starts when the user presses any key, and Simon generates a random color. The player must then repeat the sequence correctly to progress to the next level. If the player makes a mistake, the game ends, displaying the highest level achieved.
